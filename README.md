## How to do it?

### Firstly, I've created a GitHub Private repository, and published files into it.

### Then, I went to AWS
I already have a free account and I can start doing tasks.

#### Step 1: Create an IAM user

I moved to the IAM service, chose the option "create new", and added full s3 permissions

#### Step 2: Creating S3 bucket with public access
